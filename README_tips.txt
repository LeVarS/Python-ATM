Linking

To make hyperlinks put brackets around the text you want to link and then the link in parenthesis after [text](link)

Can also make links outside of the text. Example, "This is a [link][website] to a website".
[website]: www.google.com



Images

Inline images
To insert images, place the exclamation point - ! - in front of the link.
![image](link to image)

Can also do this with reference links
![image][image link reference]
[image link reference] : link to image
